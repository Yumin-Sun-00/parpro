collective: reduce, broadcast

P2P:
synch. send: wait recieve starts.
asynch. send: don't care whether the reciever starts. mpi buffer send: pass a comm. buffer

MPI_Send
MPI_Isend
MPI_Ssend
MPI_ISsend

small message: MPI tends to use buffer send.
Large message: non-buffered send.
There is a certain threshold which will trigger buffer send to non-buffer send.

Ready send: it always complete.

Blocking: blocking calls.
non-blocking: non blocking calls terminate immediatedly and return request.

me: "HW, send me the data, at some point I will check whether you completed."


Blocking P2P communication:
MPI_Send: you don't know whether it is (non-)buffered send, (a)synch send...
MPI rank is only valid inside certain MPI communicator.(namespace)
MPI_Recv:
status: query src, recieved message.
